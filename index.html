      <h3>A Colorful Dot Map of America's Immigrants - Markese Lavell Wider</h3>
      <p>My visualization critique is of a great dot density map created by <a href="http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/" target="_blank">Kyle E. Walker, Ph.D.</a>. Kyle Walker created a collection of dot density maps represetning immigrant populations in some of the major cities in the United States. To create these maps data was collected from the census at the census tract level. Walker choose to represent the immigrants according to colors which represents the regions of the world from which they originate. I particuallry like the choice of colors used to represent the immigrants and the simple base map because it allows for the data to be clearly seen and creates an appealing visual that is very understandable. I particularly like how the maps go beyond the boundaries of the cities and into the greater metroplitian areas so that you are able to see where immigrant groups may be concentrated outside of the city and makes you think about why those areas are drawing those populations. I love looking at these collection of maps because it tells you how all cities are diffent and how they all have unique cultural footprints created by immigrant populations. </p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Yvonne Knoepfel</h3>
        <p>For my visualization critique for the example of a compelling and interesting visualization I used a map from <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map" target="_blank">the New York Times on homicides in New York City</a>. </p>
        <p> The map displays the amount of committed murders in New York City from 2013-2011. 
        Each point represents a case. When hovering over a point, concrete information on the homicide, including date and time, race and age of the victim and the perpetrator is being displayed. The data can be filtered according to the different years and one can notice that the number of cases has dropped by around 70% from 2003 to 2011.</p>
        <p>I wanted to modify the colours of the points according the different boroughs. When trying to examine the data, I got an error message stating "no response data available". </p>

      <h3>Visualizing Earthquakes and Tweets about Earthquakes - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      Last week, I created a map from my critique so this week, I'm going to be critiquing my own map. Not sure if anyone remembers the earthquake in the East Coast. Everyone from California laughed, but it was pretty serious news and a revelation to a lot of us in the East Coast. I remember there were some <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/26/twitter-earthquake-video/#WbGpS69oO8q5">news</a> around how social media was the fastest channel or medium of information transfer during that event!
      <br>
      <br>
      I saw that apart from the dataset we can get from CartoDB directly, USGS also has an API for querying earthquake records in what they call geojson. API request was pretty simple, no access token was needed and I just had to specifiy in my start date, end date and the format of data.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query.json?endtime=2015-09-25&starttime=2015-09-01&format=geojson" target="_blank">See my call!</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      I pulled the json into Python actually through a library called Pandas. Saw that the geocordinates actually had three dimentions, which I presumed was some sort of "above sea level" measure. So I had to do some data cleaning where I seperated out latitude, longitude and discard that last measure. And I also had to convert their timedata from epoch times to a regular YYYY-MM-DD. This was the first time I was exposed to epoc time units. Once basic data processing was finished, I could easily export from Python Pandas to a csv file.
      <br>
      <br>
      Similar to last time, I also pulled tweets around Earthquakes that I've been collecting since two years ago. For both, I made sure that my start and end dates are 9/1/2015 - 9/25/2015 UTC. This was already pulled in a csv format. I had to do some filtering to discard tweets that does not have lat-long information (otherwise, filesize would have been prohibitively large)
      <br>
      <br>
      Then the rest was pretty simple. I uploaded the data to CartoDB. Earthquake data was around 7,000 rows and tweets data was around 31 thousand rows.
      <br>
      <br>
      <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://djdoh88.cartodb.com/viz/17e71244-6450-11e5-8ab3-0e9d821ea90d/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
      <br>
      Sadly, what I found was that I am technically unable to show two torque layers. It seems to be working but if you look at the dates carefully, two layers move in different time speed (likely because of different number of rows for each tables). And so the timeline gets messed up. So this did not do the job of mapping two events like I wanted it to.

    <h3>Homicides in NYC - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      After my failed attempt at using the torque feature, I looked for an example that was similar. And I came across this map!
      <br>
      <br>
      <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://dms2203.cartodb.com/viz/f98bdeb6-51fe-11e3-a410-3085a9a956e8/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
      <br>
      This map visualized homicidal incidents in NYC since 2003 and I thought this was a good use of the torque feature. One disadvantages of this type of visualization I found was that you can't really do much analysis and dig deeper into the data. You can maybe gather quick insight but thats about it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Still it was reassuring to see that the neighborhoods that I frequent is pretty safe.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href = "http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map" target="_blank">New York Times</a> did something similar that I felt was a little more analytically useful. It had the same timeline features but also had cumulative "All Year" view. And more details around the incident. Apart from the fact that it was in Flash, I found this this type of interactive visualization to be more insightful.

      <h3>Neutrino Hotspots on Earth - Mark Yarish</h3>
      <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/09/18/2015/mapping-out-neutrino-hotspots-here-on-earth.html">http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/09/18/2015/mapping-out-neutrino-hotspots-here-on-earth.html</a>

      <p>For my critique this week, I choose a map with highlights the Neutrino Hotspots on Earth. I had noticed the map earlier in the week, the bright colors (mostly red & orange) really attract your eyes. I had to read more about the map, the vibrant colors were screaming for my attention.</p>

      <p>I think the map works. The cartographer is trying to make a point to high light the hot spots on earth. If you take a look at the original scientific paper, the writers did map out both the natural and the man made decay. These maps were less eye catching, hence they were emitted from most of the news outlets that published the map. The oiginal maps are at http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13945</p>

      <h3>DOB Open Jobs (August 25-present) - Mark Yarish</h3>
        <p>For my current project, I created a map to show the current DOB job status for the borough of Brooklyn. At first, I downloaded the entire file which contained years worth of records for all of New York City. The file was 126 mb. This file was too large so I then used the filtering tool in the city's open data portal to just download the data for the borough of Brooklyn. </p>
        <p>
        The file for Brooklyn was 26 mb, still to large to work with in CartoDB. I opened the file in OpenRefine. I used my NYC Geoclient to convert the Bin column to new columns with both latitude and longitude. I also used OpenRefine to filter out just the Jobs for the last 30 days. I then downloaded the csv file to my computer & then uploaded it into CartoDB.</p>
        <p>I styled my map by using the Stamen Toner Basemap. Instead of using a default icon, I uploaded a hammer on a yellow background. I thought this would be eye catching. </p>
        <p>I would have liked to include all of the data for the city. Unfortunatly, I could not as it took a real long time to upload a large file to CartoDB. I would also have liked to link other data layers with stalled jobs & complaints about jobs. From looking at the map, you can see that there is so much more activity in North Brooklyn vs South Brooklyn.</p>

    <P>I used FourSquares venue API to locate the most popular check in locations in Manhattan within 2000 meters of Madison Square Garden. I included data such as the venues phone number, facebook page, and total number of check ins when clicking on each location. I would have liked to seen trending venues and check ins, in all of New York City. I also really would have liked to use a different API besides foursquare, but I ran into some problems collecting data.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 2 - Andrew Hayias</h3>
    <p>For my vizualization critique, I looked at the Guardian's comparison of the United States and China. I really like the spiral or "fan" stlye of the vizualization. It makes it easy to compare indicators and is also visually pleasing.</p>
    <p>Most of the data comes from the World Health Organization, the CIA Factbook and Forbes. The CIA factbook is from 2012,so some of the data may be older or incorrect. The website also allows you to download the full spreadsheet, which is really handy in case I wanted to do my own work with the data.</p>

      This visualization immediatly caught my attention
      <br>
      <p>I find it beautifal and captivating. I usually steer away from black base maps, as they tend to be tacky and unneccesary. I, however, keep wanting to look at this map. While aesthetically pleasing, this visualization is also informative. The colors are well balanced in relation to the data. A washed out red symbolizes the highest of buildings (250m+) with a deep blue symbolizing the lowest (0-5m). The buildings have been carefully laid out and the map can be zoomed in with no alteration (vector) to the building layouts. The map rolls overs very smoothly, with a palatable initial lag.</p>
      <p>The map indicates the highest buildings (145-240 and plus meters) are located in what appears to be a central business district. There are other various spots around the city indicating mid-height (60-145m)buildings while the rest of the city sits on a low point of 0-15m.</p>

      <h3>Visualization 02 - Allen Shaibani</h3>
      <p>For my API Data, I used the Austin Open Data portal to find 311 calls. I obtained the API via the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) using an Endpoint provided with the data. I filtered the 311 calls to show 'Loud Commercial Music' within 'TRAVIS' county. I than created a data table with open refine and exported to Excel, where I cleaned all the extra data.
      <br>
      <br>
      After cleaning the data, I imported the spreadsheet document to CartoDB where I visualized the data using Choropleth to designate the data by zip code, allowing for further examination in regards to the areas of complaints. While Category would be the more intuitive visual to display, I chose Choropleth due to the uniformity of color while still being easy to distinguish the areas. I suspect this may cause debate in proper use of visuals, but for the sake of this project, I will experiment.
      <br>
      <br>
      The noise complaints were relatively consistent with the shape of the city, with most complaints being in the urban core while following the 'mesopotamic' structure of Interstate-35 and Texas State Highway Loop 1. There was, however, one striking anomaly.  There was a cluster of complaints on the outskirts by a major highway. After further examining, I find that the area is still mostly agrarian and developing. After going into Street View with Google Earth, I find a large pre-fabricated building with a massive parking lot and fields of grass. There are banners at the border fence with 'hip' modern colors. These are the ingredients for a mega church in suburbia Texas.
      <br>
      <br>
      This non-denominational mega church is known as the 'LifeAustin Church,'' no space between Life and Austin as this is a hip modern church. The church is run by Pastor Randy Phillips, a member of Christian boy band 'Phillips, Craig and Dean.' With over 3,500 attendees every week and festivals on a regular basis, this church is most likely the source of Loud Commercial Music.

      <h3>Mapping the U.S. by Property Value Instead of Land Area - Markese Lavell Wider</h3>
      <p>My visualization critique is of a great visualization created by <a href="http://metrocosm.com/author/mgalka/" target="_blank">Max Galka</a>. Max Galka created a cartogram of the residential property value for every county in the United States (the contiguous 48 states).<br> <br> Max Galka created this cartogram using Carto3F. I am particularly intrigued by this visualization because without any information about what you are looking at it looks like some type of wild science experiment but with a little information provided this map tells a great story. From this map you can tell that most of the residential property value is located in a few concentrated areas in the United states.  </p>

      <h3>When do Americans leave for work + where the work commute is better or worse than yours - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p> <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/04/when-do-americans-leave-for-work/" target="_blank">This interactive heat map </a>  by Nathan Yau plots over a 24 hour period when commuting workers (anyone over the age of 16 who has a job) leave for work. With data sourced from the American Community Survey, it graphs at the county level the commuter population distributed by the time of commute. What's compelling about this map is that it clearly marks national trends in commutes (the highest percent of commuters leave between 7-8am, and the biggest density of those commuters are in the Midwest) as well as outliers (southwest Nevada has a lot of early-risers, and the citizens of the Aleutian Islands work a lot of night shifts). From the same survey and author, you can compare the quality of your commute to everyone else's: <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/05/where-the-commute-is-worse-and-better-than-yours//" target="_blank"> this commute is worse than yours. </a> This puts everything into perspective. When the user selects a county, the rest of the nation map re-colors to highlight how commutes in the rest of the country compare against the selected benchmark. By hovering over the compared counties, you can also see the average time difference for commutes.</p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique - Yvonne Knoepfel </h3>
      <p> Using CardoDB, I created the following map: <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://yknoepfel.cartodb.com/viz/30581046-5e6d-11e5-a396-0e853d047bba/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> which displays the abandoned buildings in Boston. I intended to create a second layer with the data of the crime report in order to see if there if crime happens more often in proximity of abandoned buildings. The data set could not be read by CardoDB (did not recognize geocoding). </p>

      <h3>ISIS Influence - Yvonne Knoepfel </h3>
      <p> On <a href="http://aleppo.firstmilegeo.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> I found this map showing the development of ISIS influence on Aleppo from October 2013 until May 2014. While the interactity of the map might be useful to show how different areas of the city change, the term «influence» is not defined (e.g. attacks, control, support). It is also likely that several political forces are operating and borders can't be drawn clearly. A geographical scale is missing, and it would be interesting to see how the population is distributed in the city to get a bigger picture of the situation.</p>

      <h3>Chicago Sanitation Compliants - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p>This data set was all sanitation complaints (code 311) in the city of Chicago between 9/6/2015 and 9/13/2015. I was curious to know if there were any geographic trends for complaint frequency and the time duration for open complaints. If the city responded to a complaint (all green dots) then I included the number of days it took the city to respond in the hover label.</p>

      <h3>Traffic Cameras in Seattle - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>This is my map of traffic cameras in Seattle, found using opendata and visualized with CartoDB. I used simple dots to represent the data, because I felt that knowing exactly where the cameras were located was important for the user. When clicking on each dot, it should tell you the address of the camera and have a link to a video if available.</p>

      <h3>Pankil Shah's Citibike Visualization - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>For my visualization critique I used Pankil Shah's citi bike data visualization found on Tableau. It contains data for every citi bike station in New York City. The map looks at frequency between stations. It shows total number of trips, total miles, and the average trip time.</p>
      <p>I really like this visualization and the data it shows. The data gets rather detailed, showing which days and hours have the most traffic and even breaks it down by gender and age. One question I have is how the data on gender is actually collected.</p>

      <h3>Bars in NYC - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p><a href="http://lamp.sla.ny.gov/nysla/index.htm" target="_blank">This</a> was an example I found of bars distributed in NYC based on the Liquor license information. I found this to be a pretty poorly constructed map. First of all, it uses Flash. Secondly, crowded data points does not aggregate to help viewers get a better sense of the distribution. There is no legend explaining what each colors and symbols mean.
      <br>
      <br>
      So I tried to create a better version using cartodb.

      <br>
      <br>
      Instead of showing all the locations with liquor store license, I've filtered down only what people would consider as "Bars" by filtering the license type. And I also excluded listings with no business names.

      <h3>Visualizing @BrooklynBrewery Engagement - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      In keeping with the theme of bars, I first wanted to try using CartoDB with a dataset that I am familiar with. So from Brandwatch I exported all the "Engagement" (Retweet or At mention) data to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>. This CartoDB map is showing geographically where people POST on Twitter reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The static set of data was taken from the past 7 days (Sep 7th 2015 - Sep 13th 2015). I tried to provide certain level of interactivity by showing the actual tweet upon clicking dot representation. There was a intensity display through the green gradient.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you zoom into North America, you can see that more people tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a> from the East Coast, and globally the brand seems to have some traction from the U.K.
