FINAL

<h3>Final Project - Oliver Mika</h3>

<a>Relevance was the theme for my final project, I wanted to cover an issue in our urban areas not talked about so much; food deserts. Income inequality and gentrification are both pressing issues that are finally being discussed to no end amongst all walks of life. However, why are we not talking about the current state of our lower income neighborhoods? Living in Bushwick, I see the tidal wave of oncoming gentrification, however what about affordability? What about the families that have lived here, and other surrounding neighborhoods for generations who can not afford to buy organic or even heathy to begin with? What about the areas that do not even have a proper grocery store within close range of low income housing, such as Brownsville, much of Bed-Stuy, or around the Bushwick homes? </a>

<a>Quick and simple solutions are needed to address the injustices of our lower income population's lack of access to fresh food, and one such solution has already come to fruition; urban gardening. With this handy tool, not only are low income families able to grow their own produce, but even buy it from other growers at an affordable price without having to commute to a grocery store. My maps illustrate the current state of the urban gardening movement using data from Greenthumb, an organization put together by the city. With these maps I've provided, not only will we look at urban gardedning now, but its future potential for expansion and easy acccess for all.</a>

<a>Above are the poverty rates for the strip of neighborhoods spanning from Green Point to Canarsie. Choosing neighborhoods as case studies was an interesting decision I had to make, because it would simply be too large of an undertaking to cover the entire borough. I felt the PUMA's I've chosen (with the exception of Bed-stuy due to a lack of data) were appropriate because all were either formerly or currently poverty stricken, and (with the exception of Williamsburg) have inconsistencies with supermarket distribution.</a>



<a>GreenThumb</a>

<a>GreenThumb is a community garden initiave put together by the city of New York. Their sizes range from small, quarter-lot sized patches to large, communal gardens. When observing the map above, it is easy to tell that these gardens tend to clump together into concentrated areas. What is particularly satisfying is that these dense areas tend to be in the vicinity of larger NYCHA facilities, which tend to be deviod of any type of normal businesses the farther away from the East river you go.</a>

 

<a>NYCHA // Brownsville</a>

<a>Taking a closer look at the greater Brownsville area; If we are judging based on section 8 alone, we notice quite a bit of concentrated poverty in what appears to be a more spread out neighborhood. These blocks hold large population sets, so while it may look like there are enough gardens in the area currently, that is not at all the case.</a>

<a>This area is deceiving. One the one hand, it looks as if there is a severe shortage of community gardens, which is true. On the other hand, although there is a lack of this specific data, since i live and walk around this entire area on a daily basis; I can tell you that there are plenty of grocery stores. However there are a few issues that this data is keeping from us. First of all, although gentrifying, Bushwick still has a fairly high poverty rate. Secondly, much of Bed-Stuy's poverty, although no accurate data is available, is spread across the neighborhood rather than being more concentrated in NYCHA housing. A third thing to keep in mind; population density is higher than that of Brownsville. In summary there are not nearly enough community gardens here and they are not evenly distributed between the two neighborhoods. Note how the middle of Bed-Stuy has nothing while most of Bushwick is lacking as well. These are areas that desperately need more even distribution.</a>

<a>It makes a world of difference when living in a big city with an incredible transportation system. Although we could all write a novel on our personal issues with the MTA, NYC is in a much better position than almost all other American cities. No part of our population benefits more than those who fall under the lower-middle class or below. Thanks to current infrastructure, whether it be trains or bus (which was not included due to a restriction on layers for the free version of CartoDB), it is already easy for many people in our study area to reach these community gardens.</a>

<a>Aside from our schools, public spaces such as parks can be ideal spots to open up new gardens, and free up more space for families, businesses and individuals alike to claim their own patches.</a>
